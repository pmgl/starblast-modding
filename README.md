*Standard Modding Interface, you can see the minimap of the mod in the bottom right corner while the mod is running*


Starblast Modding interface can be found here: https://starblast.io/modding.html ([ECP](https://starblast.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Commander_Pass) required)


Starblast Modding interface allows you to create custom mods for Starblast. The interface is made of a code editor window, on the left, and a console window, on the right. The code editor is where you type the JavaScript code for your mod. The console is where you can type commands to start your mod, stop it or interact with it while it is running.


Main programming language used in this interface is [JavaScript (ECMAScript)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp)

## Documentation and Tutorial
### Important Notes
In newer versions of browsers' updates, you can't use the Modding Client in incognito mode anymore as they restrict some incognito features which are used by the editor.

And make sure to read all of these from the start to the end so that you won't miss any important info!

### Creating your first mod
In the Mod Code window, type the code for your first mod:
```js
this.options = {
  root_mode: "survival",
  map_size: 30
};

this.tick = function(game) {
};
```

### Running and testing a mod
#### Change region
Once your mod code is ready, in the console, start by selecting your preferred region for modding using the command `region <region name>`. For example with Europe:
```
> region Europe
Region set to Europe
> █
```
(Currently modding is only available in these 3 zones: Europe, America, Asia)
#### Start mod
Then to start running your mod, type command `start`:
```
> start
Mod started
https://starblast.io#1234@12.34.56.78:2000
Use 'test' to open game frame for testing
> █
```
#### Test the mod
As instructed by the console, you may want to open a test window to join your modded game with a Starblast client. Type `test`:
```
> test
> █
```
#### ALWAYS keep the Mod Editor Tab being active while running the mod!
This is one of the most important things you need to keep in your mind!

Why? Because that's nuances of how browsers work.

Browsers slow down all javascript in non-active tabs in order to decrease the CPU processes.

For some mods (e.g Battle Royale), it doesn't matter like with ship tree and options only,

but for other mods where some logic in tick function or events - it will affect them A LOT!

Ticks start to work slower and slower...

Soon everything will be lagging in game; any reactions on mod buttons, any mod logic like spawning something in tick, etc.

And... depending on mod complexity it can CRASH THE ENTIRE MOD - locally, server will continue to work so game will still run but without mod logic anymore.

So, always keep the mod editor tab online or you may have unpredictable results!

Also, you need to have a stable internet connection if you don't want your mods becoming laggy.

#### Stop the currently running mod
You can stop your mod anytime by using the command `stop`. Note that this will kill the game and disconnect all connected players:
```
> stop
Mod stopped
> █
```
#### Other terminal commands
##### `echo`
Print any values to the terminal; can be used in both mod code (after mod started) and terminal

Syntax: `echo(<item>)`
```
> echo("Message from terminal!")
Message from terminal!
> █
```
##### `clear`
Clear the terminal, only available in the terminal

Syntax: `clear`
##### `help`
Display help message inside the terminal, terminal use only

Syntax: `help`

### Main code parts
#### Options
##### Definition
Stored in `this.options` is a data structure where you can set options for your custom modded game. These options are used for initializing the game when you start your mod. Changing them while the mod is running does not affect the game.
##### Custom ships and custom tree

You can import ships made within the Starblast Ship Editor. Use "Mod Export" feature to export a JavaScript code snippet for the modding interface. Then paste this snipped in the coding window and add this:
```js
var myship_101 = "{ … … <this is your exported ship code> …";

var ships = [myship_101]; // add your ship to an array of ship

this.options = {
  root_mode: "survival",
  ships: ships,         // specifying a list of ships to complement / replace existing ships
  reset_tree: true,     // set to true if you want to remove the original ship tree, false if you just want to replace some of the ships
  map_size: 30
};

this.tick = function(game) {
};
```
Then run your mod. If your ship is set to level=1 model=1, your ship will replace the Fly. You can replace other ships in the tree in a similar way, using `reset_tree: false`. Or you can remove the original ship tree completely and provide a whole new one using `reset_tree: true`.
##### Customizing the emote-chat system
The vocabulary used for the emote-chat system can be customized by setting the field `vocabulary` in the game option
as follows:
```js
var vocabulary = [
  { text: "Hello", icon: "\u0045", key: "O" },
  { text: "Bye", icon: "\u0046", key: "B" },
  { text: "Yes", icon: "\u004c", key: "Y" },
  { text: "No", icon: "\u004d", key: "N" },

  { text: "Flower", icon: "\u{1F33B}", key: "F" },
  { text: "Snowman", icon: "\u26c4", key: "M" },
  { text: "Shark", icon: "\u{1F988}", key: "S" },
  { text: "Ghost", icon: "\u{1F47B}", key: "G" }
];

this.options = {
  vocabulary: vocabulary,
  // ...
};
```
This allows using Starblast built-in emote icons, which are listed here for reference: https://starblast.io/glyphs.html

You can also use unicode icons, here is a good source for reference: https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html

Note that wide unicode characters (using more than 2 bytes) requires a specific Javascript syntax as shown in the example above (example: `\u{1F47B}`)

##### Custom asteroids maps
You can create a custom map of asteroids. This allows creating a maze for example. The custom map you provide is actually a JavaScript character string that is used to "paint" the map.

For example:
```js
var map =
"999999999999999999999999999999\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"999999999999999999999999999999" ;


this.options = {
  custom_map: map,
  map_size: 30
}
```

In the example above, 9 sets the biggest size of the asteroid. You can use smaller values for adding smaller asteroids to the grid. Any value other than a digit will be interpreted as no asteroid. If your `map_size` is set to 30, make sure to create 30 lines and 30 columns, or you may get unpredictable results.

**Note:** Use `""` for blank custom map

You can use [Online Map Editor](https://bhpsngum.github.io/starblast/mapeditor/) (a community tool) to create, edit and export maps.

Please [see here](https://starblast.fandom.com/wiki/Easter_Eggs#Battle_of_Titans) for more information|

Example:
```js
ship_groups: [
  ["U-Sniper","Howler"],
  ["Crusader","Pioneer"]
]
```
#### Ticking
##### Definition
Found in `this.tick` is a JavaScript function that is called 60 times per second. In this function’s body, you will be able to code specific actions that your mod needs to take automagically while the game is running. This function can be modified while the modded game is running and the changes will apply automagically.
#### Events
##### General
Your mod can receive events through the function `this.event`:
```js
this.event = function(event,game) {
  switch (event.name)
  {
    case "ship_spawned":
      if (event.ship != null)
      {
        shipJustSpawned(event.ship) ;
      }
      break ;
  }
} ;
```

##### Available events
| Event name | Description | Additional event fields |
| - | - | - |
| ship_spawned* | A ship just spawned in game or respawned | event.ship |
| ship_destroyed | A ship was just destroyed | event.ship, event.killer |
| alien_destroyed | An alien was just killed | event.alien, event.killer |
| asteroid_destroyed | A movable asteroid was just destroyed (this event won't trigger for non-movable asteroids) | event.asteroid, event.killer |
| collectible_picked | A ship just picked a collectible item | event.collectible, event.ship |

**Note:** * means that this event only works with unspecified `root_mode` (`root_mode: ""`)
### Map
#### Definition
All entities and objects in the game are moving on a 2D plane called "map"

Map can be painted with asteroids using [`this.options.custom_map`](#custom-asteroids-maps) and set size by `this.options.map_size` (even value from 20 to 200)

All Modding commands relating to coordinates will be visualized on this map
#### Coordinates
##### Axes
| Axis | Direction in user screen |
| - | - |
| X | left to right |
| Y | bottom to top |
| Z | map "depth", only used for [setting 3D Objects](#add-3d-objects-to-the-scenery) |
##### Grid
The map is divided into "grids".

A Grid is a 10x10 square area which can only contain 1 static asteroid (which equals to 1 character to "paint" the map in [`this.options.custom_map`](#custom-asteroids-maps))

`map_size` is the number of grids along each dimension, which means that the number of grids in the map is calculated by the formula `map_size`<sup>2</sup>.

For example: `map_size` being 30 means that there are 30 grid length along the X Axis and Y Axis, and 30<sup>2</sup> = 900 grids total in the map
##### Center and Boundaries
Map center (x:0, y:0) is located in the Sun

Based on the [Grid definition](#Grid), we have:

Each Axis will have `map_size` / 2 grids length in both negative and positive part

Because each grid is a 10x10 square, the boundary of each part is `map_size` / 2 x 10 = `map_size` x 5

Means that each Axis varies from -`map_size` x 5 to `map_size` x 5

For example: with `map_size` = 30, each Axis in the map varies from -300 (`-60x5`) to 300 (`60x5`)
### Game step
#### Definition
Can be accessible through `game.step`; an integer presenting the game's duration
#### Unit
The unit of this value is tick, where 1 tick = 1/60 seconds

Which means that 60 ticks = 1 second, 120 ticks = 2 seconds and so on.
#### Uses
This code uses to set the first ship in the list to the center of the map in the first minute of the mod and reset its crystals every 5 seconds (assume that there is one ship staying from the start of the mod):
```js
this.tick = function (game)
{
  if (game.step == 3600) { // 1 minute = 60 seconds * 60
    game.ships[0].set({x:0,y:0}); // Center teleport
  }
  if (game.step % 300 === 0) { // 5 seconds * 60
    game.ships[0].set({crystals: 0}); // Reset crystals
  }
}
```

### Ships
You can access the list of ships (players) through the array `game.ships`

You can also find a ship with a specific id using `game.findShip(id)`, which returns an object representing the matched ship or `null` (if no ships are matching the provided id)
#### Accessible fields
You have read access to the ship’s main fields and options:

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| id | A unique identifier for the ship |
| game | Points to the global `game` object |
| x | X coordinate |
| y | Y coordinate |
| vx | Velocity vector X component |
| vy | Velocity vector Y component |
| r | Rotation angle of the ship (in radian) |
| name | player's name |
| alive | Whether the ship is alive or destroyed |
| type | Ship type code (e.g. 101) |
| stats | Ship current stats upgrades, compiled into a single integer.<br>For example: 10012301 means the 8 stats upgrade levels are 1,0,0,1,2,3,0 and 1 |
| idle | tells if the ship is in idle status or not |
| team | the id of the team this ship is in |
| score | player's score |
| shield | current shield value |
| generator | current generator value |
| crystals | current crystals value |
| healing | whether the ship's lasers are in healing mode or not |

#### Configuration
You can set different options on the ships. For example:
```
> game.ships[0].set({x:0,y:0});
> █
```
Will move the first ship in the list to the center of the map

List of accepted options when using `ship.set`:

| Option | Description | Server response error message<br>(if improper) |
| - | - | - |
| x | X coordinate | Wrong coordinate |
| y | Y coordinate | Wrong coordinate |
| vx | Velocity vector X component | Wrong coordinate |
| vy | Velocity vector Y component | Wrong coordinate |
| invulnerable | Use to set the ship invulnerable for X ticks (e.g. 60 for one second invulnerability) | Wrong invulnerable time |
| type | changes the type of ship (use the ship code, e.g. `{type:403}` ) | None |
| angle | changes the direction the ship is facing | Wrong angle |
| score | sets player's score | Wrong score |
| idle | set to true to force the ship to stay idle (and false to revert) | None |
| shield | sets the value of the shield | Wrong shield value |
| generator | sets the value of the generator | Wrong generator value |
| healing | sets ship's lasers mode to healing (true or false) | None |
| crystals | sets ship's crystal amount | Wrong crystals |
| stats | set the stats upgrades of the ship | None |
| kill | Set `kill: (any "truthy" value, e.g: true)` to destroy the ship | No violation |
| team | Changes the team this ship belongs to (in range [0-X] where X is teams - 1) | None |
| collider | Change the ship's collider (the ship can interact with other objects in-game or not), must be `true` or `false` | None |
| hue | Sets the colour of the ship (range [0-359])![Hue map](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YOBFy.png) | None |

#### Intermission
You can send the ship to intermission (a screen with results, offering to respawn). This screen allows you to display custom results information:
```
> game.ships[0].intermission({"Best Achievement":"Managed to run the mod","Score":1234});
> █
```
#### Triggering and Customizing player's GameOver screen
You can also trigger the gameover screen for any given ship. Here again, you can pass results information to pass on to the player:
```
> game.ships[0].gameover({"Rating":"Can do better","Score":1234});
> █
```
#### Instructor
##### Calling instructor
You can have the flight instructor send instructions to the player. For this find the player's ship and use:
```
> ship.instructorSays("Hello!")
> █
```
You can hide the instructor window using:
```
> ship.hideInstructor()
> █
```
You can later show it again using:
```
> ship.showInstructor()
> █
```
A second, optional parameter allows you to choose which one of the instructor characters will talk to the player. Example:
```
> ship.instructorSays("Here is your report, Commander","Maria")
> █
```
##### Available characters

#### Custom UI components
##### General
The mod can create custom UI components that will show up on the player’s screen. This is done by calling `setUIComponent` on the ship - passing in a component descriptor.

For example:
```
> ship.setUIComponent({
    id:"myid",
    position:[0,0,25,25],
    clickable: true,
    shortcut: "X",
    visible: true,
    components: [
      { type:"box",position:[0,0,100,100],fill:"#456",stroke:"#CDE",width:2},
      { type: "text",position: [0,0,100,50],color: "#FFF",value: "My Text"},
      { type: "player",id: 1, position: [0,0,50,50],color: "#FFF"},
    ]
  })
> █
```
Here is the list of UIComponent's accepted options:

| Option | Description | Default value<br>(if omitted) |
| - | - | - |
| id | a unique identifier for this component, mandatory | None (component won't be set)|
| position | expressed in percentage of the main screen, the position of the component [x,y,width,height]. Example: `[45,45,10,10]` creates a component in the center of the screen, in which width and height are 10% of the screen width and height. | Client-based positions (`"radar_background"` and `"scoreboard"` id, see [this section](#customizing-the-scoreboard-or-radar))<br>`[0,0,100,100]` (others) |
| visible | Whether the component is visible or not. Resend the same data with visible set to false to hide the component | true |
| clickable | Whether this component can be clicked or not | false |
| shortcut | When the component is clickable, a keyboard shortcut allowing to trigger the click event | None (no shortcuts) |
| components | gives a list (array) of graphical features to render within the component, which will be described below | Empty array (`[]`) |

##### Subcomponents' accepted options
| Option | Description | Default value (if omitted) |
| - | - | - |
| type | type of the subcomponent<br>currently supported: "round", "text", "box" or "player" | None (subcomponent won't be rendered) |
| id ("player" type only) | id of the player associated with the subcomponent, which will be disapleyd as their name and badge (if exists) in the rendered subcomponent | None (blank player info) |
| position | positions of the subcomponent, formatted as `[x,y,width,height]`<br>that subcomponent are meant within the main component coordinates | None (subcomponent won't be rendered) |

| align | alignment of the texts inside the subcomponent<br>"left", "right" or "center" only | `"center"` |

##### Combining with events
The example below creates a warp button for every player, which can be clicked and results in the ship warping to another random location, adding 3 seconds invulnerability to it:

Full example: https://github.com/pmgl/starblast-modding/blob/master/examples/warp_button.js
```js
var warp_button = {
  id: "warp",
  position: [2,50,8,14],
  clickable: true,
  shortcut: "W",
  visible: true,
  components: [
    { type:"round",position:[0,0,100,100],fill:"#456",stroke:"#CDE",width:2},
    { type: "text",position:[10,35,80,30],value:"WARP",color:"#CDE"},
    { type: "text",position:[20,70,60,20],value:"[W]",color:"#CDE"}
    ]
};

var warpShip = function(ship) {
  x = (Math.random()-.5) * ship.game.options.map_size*10 ;
  y = (Math.random()-.5) * ship.game.options.map_size*10 ;
  ship.set({x:x,y:y,vx:0,vy:0,invulnerable:180}) ;
} ;

this.tick = function(game) {
  if (game.step%60==0) // ensure this is done only once per second
  {
    for (var i=0;i<game.ships.length;i++)
    {
      var ship = game.ships[i] ;
      if (!ship.custom.warp_button_installed)
      {
        ship.custom.warp_button_installed = true;
        ship.setUIComponent(warp_button);
      }
    }
  }
} ;

this.event = function(event,game) {
  switch (event.name)
  {
    case "ui_component_clicked":
      var ship = event.ship ;
      var component = event.id ;
      if (component == "warp") // check that this is our component "warp"
      {
        warpShip(ship);
      }
      break ;
  }
} ;
```

##### Customizing the scoreboard or radar
The built-in scoreboard or radar can be replaced by your own custom scoreboard/radar component. As soon as an UI component with id `"scoreboard"` or `"radar_background"` is created, you will be responsible for updating the scoreboard/radar. Your custom scoreboard/radar component does not have to include a `position` because it will automatically fill the area already reserved for the perspective UI Component.

##### Global UI
You can use `game.setUIComponent({ options })` to set the UI to all current players in the game

#### Other methods and instances
##### Remove all ship's secondary slots
Syntax: `ship.emptyWeapons()`

### Aliens
You can access the list of aliens through the array `game.aliens`

You can also find an alien with a specific id using `game.findAlien(id)`, which returns an object representing the matched alien or `null` (if no aliens are matching the provided id)
#### Creation
To create an alien, use `game.addAlien({ options })`

### Add 3D objects to the scenery
The mod can create custom, textured 3D objects and add them to the scenery using `game.setObject` method.

#### Notes
* All URLs included in this method must satisfy these conditions:
  1. The protocol must be `https`
  1. The domain only matches one of these domains:
    * `starblast.io` (Official Starblast site)
    * `starblast.data.neuronality.com` (Starblast Data site)
    * `raw.githubusercontent.com` (Raw GitHub)
* A dimensional property included in this method is defined as an object with three fields represent 3 Axes in [Coordinates](#coordinates)

| Field | Represent for |
| - | - |
| x | X Axis |
| y | Y Axis |
| z | Z Axis |

#### Object instance options
| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| id | a unique identifier for this object instance (mandatory, allows changing the object afterwards) |
| type | [the object type definition](#object-type-options) |
| position | coordinates for placing the object, dimensional property |
| scale | allows scaling the object, dimensional property |
| rotation | allows rotating the object, dimensional property |

#### Object type options
| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| id | a unique identifier for this object type, mandatory |
| obj | a URL to the OBJ file |
| diffuse | a URL to a diffuse texture file (optional) |
| emissive | a URL to an emissive texture file (optional) |

#### Object physics options
**Note:** We recommend not to use this property as it usually doesn't work as expected

| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| mass | Object mass, same as the `specs.ship.mass` property in [Ship Editor Tutorial](https://starblast.fandom.com/wiki/Ship_Editor_Tutorial)<br>**Note:** If the mass is too small (<100), ships can go through the object |
| shape | Object's shape, used for creating hitbox<br>You can omit this property to set default shape generated from the object itself or provide an array for your custom shape |

For example:
```js
var cube = {
  id: "cube",
  obj: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmgl/starblast-modding/master/objects/cube/cube.obj",
  diffuse: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmgl/starblast-modding/master/objects/cube/diffuse.jpg"
} ;

game.setObject({
  id: "cube",
  type: cube,
  position: {x:0,y:0,z:0},
  rotation: {x:0,y:0,z:0},
  scale: {x:1,y:1,z:1}
}) ;
```

#### Accessing
Game property `game.objects` stores all active 3D Objects maintained by the mod

You shouldn't modify this property to keep the mod running smoothly
#### Changing or moving an object
Use `game.setObject` again with the same object instance id.

#### Removing an object
`game.removeObject(id)` removes the object with given id. You can omit the id parameter, which will remove all custom objects in the scene.
#### Example
Working example, adding cube objects to the scenery: https://github.com/pmgl/starblast-modding/blob/master/examples/adding_cube.js
### Reading game's detailed options
#### Accessing
Once the mod starts running, all detailed options will be passed into the `game.options` object
#### Accessible fields
This includes all properties defined in [`this.options`](#options), plus some extended fields listed below (except if they are not defined):

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| bouncing_lasers | if bouncing lasers is enabled or not |
| max_tier_lives | number of lives when the player reaches ships with the highest level (defined in `max_level` option) |

| deposit_shield<br>spawning_shield<br>structure_shield | an array presenting the the stations' deposits/spawnings/small structures shield in the increasing level order |
| deposit_regen<br>spawning_regen<br>structure_regen | an array presenting the the stations' deposits/spawnings/small structures regeneration in the increasing level order |

### Assigning custom properties to some entities/objects
You can assign properties into some game entities or objects as side notes/indicators
#### Accessing and assigning
Simply just call out their `custom` property (which is always an object) and assign properties to it.

#### Supported objects/entities
* `game` object
* all ships
* all aliens
* all collectibles
* all asteroids
#### Example
```js
game.custom.hasMod = true // game object
game.ships[0].custom.userScore = 6712 // ship entity
game.aliens[0].custom = {created: true, rating: "10stars"} // alien entity
game.asteroids[0].custom = {init: true} // asteroid entity
```

### Other game instances and methods
#### Set custom maps in-game
You can use `game.setCustomMap(<map pattern>)` to set custom map while the game is running

where `<map pattern>` has the same format as [the custom map in `this.options`](#custom-asteroids-maps)

#### Lock/unlock the mod from attracting new players
Use `game.setOpen(true/false)` to lock/unlock the mod to be visible to players (only for [Modding Space](https://starblast.fandom.com/wiki/Modding_Space) mods)

There is also game boolean properties `game.is_open` is used to determine if the mod is open or not

### Common problems and how to fix them
#### Black screen issue
In most cases, you're getting a black screen after loading your mod due to a bad ship tree.

Follow these rules to avoid it:

1. Your ship tree must have a ship with type/code 101.
1. If your ship tree has level 2 ships, then it should have level 1 ships too.
1. Either models should go in the right order without gaps: 1, 2, 3 etc (not 1, 6, 17) or control all ship tree routes by `next` parameter in ship codes (but keep correct order for unreachable ships).
1. You can't have possibly infinite ship tree routes, made by `next` parameters - all routes should end at some ship, there shouldn't be able to come back to some ship again.

#### My mod closed accidentally but the game is not stopped
Sometimes, some unexpected problems can crash the mod, but it only disconnects from the modding side, or so-called "controller" side, the game itself will continue running without control from your modding client until it meets the closing requirements (or even in some serious occasions, game developers - like PMGL - need to close it by themselves).

Here are some reasons which can lead to mod crashing:

1. Closing/Reloading the modding tab/window without stopping the mod first (Most common one)
1. Very unstable internet connection
1. Server resolve error (which will automatically disconnect the controller by itself)
1. Browser tab hangs/crashes (careful of infinite while/for loops)

Also keep in mind that you can't reconnect to your previously crashed server, even if it's still running.

### Modding tips and tricks
#### How can I set the sun in my mod to be like this (which could be seen in every [ACW](https://starblast.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha_Centauri_Wars)/[AOW](https://starblast.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha_Orionis_Wars) games)?

![The special sun in the AOW](resource_img/aow_sun.png)

You will only need to set `max_players` to a value higher or equal to 200, and `root_mode` as `"team"`
